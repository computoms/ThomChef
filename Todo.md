# Refactoring

* Change enumerations (category, unit types) to static classes with friendly names, etc so that it's easier to convert to string and display
* Implement an iterator for the ingredients
* Implement an iterator for the recipes inside RecipeStore
* Create the XML file if it does not exist yet (for first startup)
* Implement Recipe ids so that two recipes can have the same name but be unique
