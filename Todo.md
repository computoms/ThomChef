# Refactoring

* Generate the description of recipes (to be printer to pdf for example) in the generation of random recipes
* Issue with Recipe ids => generation within 1s is too much when importing form a web-page. Find another mechanism to generate unique ids for recipes.
	- Todo: cleanup maxId when deleting recipes?
